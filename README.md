### Modern and user-friendly Discord bot

Shinshi is a powerful and intuitive Discord bot designed to enhance server management and user interaction. It offers a wide range of tools to help administrators streamline their tasks while providing entertainment and utility features for users. With easy setup and flexible customization, Shinshi adapts to any serverâ€™s needs, making management smoother and improving the overall user experience.

Originally conceived in 2022, Shinshi aimed to create a modern and reliable Discord bot. However, throughout much of 2023, the project faced a period of overthinking, which made the bot more complex than necessary. Fortunately, a shift in focus led to significant improvements, streamlining the bot's functionality and returning to a philosophy of simplicity. Now, Shinshi is easier to use and more efficient.

The name "Shinshi" reflects the lead developer's love for chinchillas and draws from Japanese tradition. In Shinto shrines, Shinshi were revered guardians of sacred places, and the term literally means "divine servant" or "messenger of god." This name underscores the project's main goal.
